<h3>Visualizing your code</h3>
	<p>
		The staff has written a graphical interface to the project to 
		allow you to visualize how 
		your algorithms go about solving puzzles. 
		The GUI allows you to view initial configurations, 
		see your algorithm run (at chosen speeds) on an initial configuration, 
		and move manually through the 
		moves generated by your code. 
		We recommend that you use the GUI to explore different search algorithms 
		and the optimality of the move lists that they produce. 
		Note that faster algorithms may not necessarily be 
		optimal. Your aim in this project is the speed of your algorithm.

<h4> Using the GUI </h4>
	<p>
		The GUI requires two files to simulate an algorithm: 
		the initial block configuration file, and the list of 
		moves output by your code. Alternatively, 
		if you just want to view an initial tray configuration, click 
		"cancel" when it asks you for a moves file. To get started using the GUI:
		<ul>
			<li> Move to the directory where you plan to conduct all your testing. 
			This directory should have all your class files, as well as copied versions 
			of any tests you plan on running. </li>
			<li> Create output files of the moves that your solver produces by 
			entering: 
<pre>
java Solver inputfile goalfile &gt; outputfile 
</pre>
For example:
<pre>
java Solver 1x1 1x1.goal &gt; 1x1.out 
</pre>

			</li>
			<li> Then copy <tt>proj3GUI.jar</tt> to this directory. 
			(A "jar" file can be thought of as a library of java classes 
			that are ready to be used.)
<pre>
cp ~cs61bl/code/proj3/gui/<WBR>proj3GUI.jar . 
</pre>
			Note the period at the end of the <tt>cp</tt>.
			</li>
			<li> Run the jar and follow its instructions.
<pre>
java -jar proj3GUI.jar 
</pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<h4> Features </h4>
	<p>
		<ul>

			<li>You can pause, play and step through execution of moves.</li>
			<li>You can adjust the delay between the animation of each move by 
			dragging the slider.</li>
			<li>A progress bar indicates the percentage of moves that have already 
			been executed.</li> 
			<li>The GUI adaptively sets the default delay based upon the number of 
			moves that you have to execute.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pause: <tt>Alt + p</tt></li>
			<li>Play: <tt>Alt + Enter</tt></li>
			<li>Next move: <tt>Alt + n</tt></li>
			<li>Previous move: <tt>Alt + r</tt></li>

		</ul>
